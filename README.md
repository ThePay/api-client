#  PHP SDK for ThePay.cz

This is the official highly compatible public package of The Pay SDK which
interacts with The Pay's REST API. To get started see examples below.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3+
- **curl** extension
- **json** extension

## Installation

To install the SDK we recommend to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require thepay/api-client

## Preconditions

Make sure that you have all required credentials and that you've set up the API access in [administration](https://admin.thepay.cz):

- merchant ID
- project ID
- password for API access
- enabled your IP address in project settings (you have to add IP address or IP address range of your server)

**To test the integration** you can create simplified "ready-to-go" DEMO account in our [DEMO environment](https://demo.admin.thepay.cz/registration).

You can find all the necessary credentials in "Implementation" section under your merchant profile:

## Usage

You will work with only two classes when using this SDK.
- TheConfig - for setting up the library
- TheClient - for main functionality (calling the API, rendering helpers)

## Configuration

All constructor parameters are described in [php doc](src/TheConfig.php)

```php
$config = new ThePay\ApiClient\TheConfig(
    $merchantId,
    $projectId,
    $apiPassword,
    $apiUrl,
    $gateUrl
);

$config->setLanguage($language);
```

## Usual workflow

There are three steps when creating a payment:
- creating a link through which the customer will realize the payment
- hadling the return of customer to your website
- handling server to server notification, which are sent by us everytime the payment state is changed

All of these steps will need to be implemented by yourself, but fear not, we have prepared examples that you can take on your journey through our SDK.

### 1. Payment creation

The payment (link) can be created via two methods:
- REST API
- Redirection

No matter what method you choose, you have two more options, based on preselection of payment method:
- Payment method preselected in e-shop
- Payment method NOT preselected - the customer will select payment method at ThePay gate

Even if you (or your customer) preselect the payment method, it can still be changed after redirection, unless specifically forbidden.

#### REST API
You can create payment (link) via REST API and redirect user to that link. The payment itself is created through an API call.
This is the preferred way for custom forms and if you want to redirect user after the whole cart process is finished.

The payment method can be preselected on your side and simply added as payment parameter to the API.
Otherwise, the customer will be presented with payment method selection on visiting ThePay gate through generated link.

The payment link is returned to you in a response, upon calling the API endpoint for payment creation.

#### Redirection of customer
The second (simpler) method is to redirect customer to payment gate with payment parameters. The payment itself will be created as soon as customer is redirected.
This SDK will generate payment buttons which will do all the work.

The payment method can be preselected in your e-shop and simply added as payment parameter to the correct method.
Otherwise, the customer will be presented with payment method selection on visiting ThePay gate through generated link.

The payment link is generated by the SDK, upon using the method for generating the payment button/s.
The payment on our side is created at the moment the customer visits the link.

#### TL;DR - summary
These are the usual ways for payment creation:
- API - creating the payment through API call (selection of payment method either in e-shop or ThePay gate)
- Redirection with selection of payment method in ThePay gateway
- Redirection with selection of payment method in the e-shop

For more examples see [create-payment.md](doc/create-payment.md)

```php
use ThePay\ApiClient\TheConfig;
use ThePay\ApiClient\TheClient;
use ThePay\ApiClient\Model\CreatePaymentParams;

$merchantId = '86a3eed0-95a4-11ea-ac9f-371f3488e0fa';
$projectId = 3;
$apiPassword = 'secret';
$apiUrl = 'https://demo.api.thepay.cz/'; // production: 'https://api.thepay.cz/'
$gateUrl = 'https://demo.gate.thepay.cz/'; // production: 'https://gate.thepay.cz/'

$config = new TheConfig($merchantId, $projectId, $apiPassword, $apiUrl, $gateUrl);
$thePay = new TheClient($config);

// Render payment methods for payment (100,- Kč)
$paymentParams = new CreatePaymentParams(10000, 'CZK', 'uid124');

// display button, user will choose payment method at the payment gate
echo $thePay->getPaymentButton($paymentParams);

// or buttons with available payment methods, payment method will be preselected
// echo $thePay->getPaymentButtons($paymentParams);

// or just get payment link and redirect customer whenever you want
// $payment = $thePay->createPayment($createPayment);
// $redirectLink = $payment->getPayUrl();
```

### 2. Customer return

That means customer has returned from payment gate. you should check the state of payment at this point: the payment can be paid. The customer could change payment method, so check that too if you need this information.

Return url is set in administration and customer will be redirected there with two query parameters added - payment_uid and project_id (needed if you have one endpoint for multiple projects).

```php
use ThePay\ApiClient\TheConfig;
use ThePay\ApiClient\TheClient;
use ThePay\ApiClient\Model\CreatePaymentParams;

$uid = $_GET["payment_uid"];
$projectId = $_GET["project_id"];

$merchantId = '86a3eed0-95a4-11ea-ac9f-371f3488e0fa';
$apiPassword = 'secret';
$apiUrl = 'https://demo.api.thepay.cz/'; // production: 'https://api.thepay.cz/'
$gateUrl = 'https://demo.gate.thepay.cz/'; // production: 'https://gate.thepay.cz/'

$config = new TheConfig($merchantId, $projectId, $apiPassword, $apiUrl, $gateUrl);
$thePay = new TheClient($config);

$payment = $thePay->getPayment($uid);
echo $payment->getState();
```

### 3. Server to server notification

It's basically the same as second step (customer return), it's triggered everytime the payment has changed, for example when the state of payment has been changed.

```php
use ThePay\ApiClient\TheConfig;
use ThePay\ApiClient\TheClient;
use ThePay\ApiClient\Model\CreatePaymentParams;

$uid = $_GET["payment_uid"];
$projectId = $_GET["project_id"];

$merchantId = '86a3eed0-95a4-11ea-ac9f-371f3488e0fa';
$apiPassword = 'secret';
$apiUrl = 'https://demo.api.thepay.cz/'; // production: 'https://api.thepay.cz/'
$gateUrl = 'https://demo.gate.thepay.cz/'; // production: 'https://gate.thepay.cz/'

$config = new TheConfig($merchantId, $projectId, $apiPassword, $apiUrl, $gateUrl);
$thePay = new TheClient($config);

$payment = $thePay->getPayment($uid);
if ($payment->getState() === 'paid') {
    // send email to customer or change something in database
}
```

## More and detailed usage examples

You can find more usage examples at [folder /doc](doc/index.md).

## Money calculations

For safe money calculations we recommend to use [moneyphp/money](https://github.com/moneyphp/money) package.
Please, do not use float to save information about prices because of its inaccuracy.

    composer require moneyphp/money
